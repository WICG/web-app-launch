        This specification defines an API that allows web applications to
        configure the behaviour of app launches with respect to already open app
        instances. This API aims to cater to the needs of single instance web
        apps e.g. music players.

        In order to implement this API, the user agent MUST support
        [[[appmanifest]]].

        Usage Example
      </h2>
      <p>
        A music player app wants to direct app shortcut launches to an existing
        window without interrupting music playback. This music app would add a
        [=manifest/launch_handler=] entry to the [[[appmanifest]]], as shown:
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="manifest.webmanifest">
      {
        "name": "Music Player",
        "shortcuts": [{
          "name": "Now Playing",
          "url": "/"
        }, {
          "name": "Library",
          "url": "/library"
        }, {
          "name": "Favorites",
          "url": "/favorites"
        }, {
          "name": "Discover",
          "url": "/discover"
        }],
        "launch_handler": {
          "client_mode": "focus-existing"
        }
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The [=manifest/client_mode=] parameter set to
        [=client mode/focus-existing=] causes app launches to bring
        existing app instances (if any) into focus without navigating them away
        from their current document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A {{LaunchParams}} will be enqueued on the {{Window/launchQueue}} where
        the music player can read the {{LaunchParams/targetURL}} in its
        {{LaunchConsumer}} and handle it in script e.g.:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="page.js">
        window.launchQueue.setConsumer((launchParams) => {
          const url = launchParams.targetURL;
          // If the URL is to one of the app sections, updates the app view to
          // that section without interrupting currently playing music.
          if (maybeFocusAppSection(url)) {
            return;
          }
          // Could not handle the launch in-place, just navigate the page
          // (interrupts any playing music).
          location.href = url;
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        A user, already using the music player app to listen to music,
        activating the "Library" app shortcut will trigger an app launch to
        /library which gets routed to the existing app instance, enqueued in the
        page's {{Window/launchQueue}} which, through the assigned
        {{LaunchConsumer}}, brings the library section of the music player into
        focus without affecting the current music playback.

          The <dfn data-dfn-for="manifest">`client_mode`</dfn> member of the
          [=manifest/launch_handler=] is a [=string=] or list of [=strings=]
          that specify one or more [=client mode targets=]. A [=client mode target=]
          declares a particular client selection and navigation behaviour to use
          for web apps launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents MAY support only a subset of the [=client mode targets=]
          depending on the constraints of the platform (e.g. mobile devices may
          not support multiple app instances simultaneously).
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            The <dfn>client mode targets</dfn> are as follows:

            <dd>
              The user agent's default launch routing behaviour is used.
              <p class="note">
                The user agent is expected to decide what works best for the
                platform. e.g., on mobile devices that only support single app
                instances the user agent may use `navigate-existing`,
                while on desktop devices that support multiple windows the user
                agent may use `navigate-new` to avoid data loss.

              If an existing web app client is open it is brought to focus and
              navigated to the launch's target URL. If there are no existing web
              app clients the [=client mode/navigate-new=] behaviour is used instead.

              web app clients the [=client mode/navigate-new=] behaviour is used
              instead.
              <p class="warning">
                It is necessary for the page to have a {{LaunchConsumer}} set on

        <p>
          The steps to <dfn>process unconsumed launch params</dfn> given a
          {{LaunchQueue}} |queue| are as follows:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>If the [=assigned launch consumer=] |consumer| is set on
                |queue|:
              <ol>
                <li>[=list/For each=] |launch_params:LaunchParams| of
                    the |queue|'s [=unconsumed launch params=]:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Invoke |consumer| with |launch_params|.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Set |queue|'s [=unconsumed launch params=] to the empty
                    list.

          {{LaunchParams}} are passed to the document via a {{LaunchQueue}}

          firing and page scripts attaching the event listener. In contrast the
          {{LaunchQueue}} buffers all enqueued {{LaunchParams}} until a
          {{LaunchConsumer}} has been set.
